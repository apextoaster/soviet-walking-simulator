# Soviet Walking Simulator Source Code

This repository contains all of the scene and script source code for the Soviet Walking Simulator game, which is
available on itch.io: https://apextoaster.itch.io/soviet-walking-simulator

This repository does not contain any of the models, textures, or sounds. I am planning on releasing the models later,
but the textures and sounds are not original and quite large.

There is a room for improvement in some of the interaction scripts, which could probably benefit from using the event
bus.

## License

Some of the scripts are based on or contain elements of the Godot engine tutorials. Where those parts were used as-is,
they remain under the original license.

The `scripts/ikcc.gd` script file is from https://github.com/DinkeyKing/Improved-KCC, which is also released under the
same MIT license as this repository and requires attribution.
